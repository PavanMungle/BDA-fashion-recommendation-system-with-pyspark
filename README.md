# BDA-fashion-recommendation-system-with-pyspark

A recommender system makes a prediction based on user’s historical behaviour.” Have you ever noticed how Spotify recommends you a list of romantic music once you start listening to Ed Sheeran? This boils down to recommendation systems’ capabilities and their ability to predict a set of items based on your past preference.

Two common approaches used involve Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering-Based recommender systems. The content-based algorithm uses characteristics of an item to come up with the recommendation rather than relying on your interaction or a feedback loop from other users.

We all love listening to our favourite music every day. It is pretty hard to find songs similar to our taste and we would love a system to do this for us. We have music applications like Spotify, Wynk that uses content-based and collaborative filtering to recommend us songs similar to what we like. In this project, I would like to show you how to implement a content-based music recommendation system, that takes songs from our liked playlist and recommend similar songs from a streaming data source.
